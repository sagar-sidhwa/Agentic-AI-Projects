# 🤖 Agentic AI | LLM | RAG & GenAI Projects by Sagar Sidhwa

Welcome to my specialized repository for **Generative AI, Autonomous Agents, and Large Language Models**. 

While my [Machine Learning Repo](https://github.com/sagar-sidhwa/Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Projects) focuses on statistical modeling and predictive analytics, **this repository** explores the frontier of AI: **Systems that think, plan, and act.** Here, I build sophisticated RAG pipelines, multi-agent workflows using LangGraph, LangChain, MCP and LLM-powered applications.

## 💡 Vision & Engineering Philosophy

As an AI/ML Engineer specializing in LLMs and Agentic Workflows, my focus here is moving beyond simple "chatbots" to create:

- **Autonomous Agents:** Systems that use tools, reasoning, and memory to solve multi-step problems.
- **Agentic RAG:** Retrieval pipelines that don't just fetch data, but grade relevance and hallucination before answering.
- **Orchestration:** Using **LangGraph** to build cyclic, stateful control flows (DAGs) rather than linear chains.
- **Evaluation:** Rigorous testing of LLM outputs using framework-specific metrics.

## 🚀 Featured Agentic & GenAI Projects [AI/ML/LLM]

### ✅ Agents & Orchestration (LangGraph / LangChain / MCP) | RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) & NLP
| Project | Architecture | Tech Stack | Summary |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **📉 AI Data Analyst Agent** | StateGraph (3-Node Workflow) | **Gemini 2.5**, **LangGraph**, Pandas, Seaborn | A "Virtual Data Scientist" that takes raw, messy files and executes Python code. Features a **Smart Cleaner Node** (Statistical Imputation) and an **Execution Node** to generate visualizations from natural language. |
| **🤖 ReSo - AI Agent ATS Resume Scorer** | Multi-Agent (Router + Scraper + scorer) | **Gemini 2.5**, **LangGraph**, LangChain, Web Scraper | An autonomous hiring agent that reverse-engineers ATS logic. It routes between web-scraping (for URLs) and text parsing (for PDFs) to provide a "Gap Analysis" and match score against job descriptions. |
| **🩺 Care AI - Virtual Nurse Agent** | Fine-Tuned SLM (Persona Adapted) | **Flan-T5-small**, **LoRA/PEFT**, PyTorch, Custom Inference Engine | A behavioral simulator trained for 5 days on empathetic medical dialogue. Features a **Dynamic Inference Engine** that adapts tone (comforting a child vs. strict safety protocols) to provide human-like bedside manner. |
| **🚀 DevOps Specialist AI Agent - CI/CD Pipeline Insight Engine** | Hybrid (Fine-Tuned LoRA + RAG) | **Flan-T5-small**, **FAISS**, PyTorch, LoRA, Transformers | A dual-path insight engine for CI/CD & Kubernetes. Combines a **LoRA fine-tuned specialist model** (for reasoning) with a **FAISS vector store** (for grounding) to deliver hallucination-free technical answers. |
| **🏥 Hospital AI - Healthcare Regulations Agent** | Hybrid (Fine-Tuned LoRA + RAG) | **Flan-T5-small**, **FAISS**, PyTorch, HIPAA/WHO Datasets | A domain-specific agent for hospital norms & compliance. Uses semantic search to retrieve official regulations (CDC, HIPAA) and a fine-tuned LLM to generate accurate, safety-critical responses. |

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Sagar Sidhwa**, a Computer Science Master's Graduate (AI Major) passionate about **Agentic AI**, **Generative AI Engineering**, **ML systems**. I bridge the gap between "Cool Demo" and "Production System" by applying robust software engineering principles to LLM workflows with my experience in AI/ML Engineering, Data Science, or Applied LLM Research. 

I am actively seeking roles as an **AI Engineer**, **LLM Developer**, or **Machine Learning Engineer**.
